// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// "open-graph-image-alt" is a description of what is in the image (not a caption). When changing "open-graph-image" to
// a custom picture, you must provide a custom string for "open-graph-image-alt".
//
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
//
// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

Nowadays, it’s normal to see cloud-native solutions dealing with a huge amount of information. In this scenario, the NoSQL databases are getting a huge relevant position, but dealing with many NoSQL solutions from many different vendors is very difficult.

In terms of dealing with relational databases, there’s no doubt that JPA specification is a well-established API in the Java world, but what if there’s a well-defined way, pretty similar to JPA, to work with NoSQL with Java?

In this blogpost, let's discuss and learn why Jakarta NoSQL can make easier the developer's life regarding the Java NoSQL database integration.


== NoSQL Overview

For some ones, NoSQL stands fot "Not Only SQL", for others stands for "Non-SQL" or "Not Relational" but one thing we may agree: NoSQL databases are different to SQL databases.

Unlike to the traditional SQL databases that use tabular relations to store and retrieve its data with predefined schemas, NoSQL Databases provide mechanisms for retrieving and storing unstructured and semi-structured data (non-relational). Compared to relational databases, NoSQL databases have better performance and high levels of availability and scalability, which means, they are designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across many servers, making them well-suited for handling large and growing datasets. As they are becoming more popular in several industries, such as finance and streaming, the number of users and database vendors are growing as well.

There are many NoSQL databases types, each one is designed to handle a specific set of workloads and data modeling needs.

== Different types of NoSQL Database

Many NoSQL databases types exists, but let's focus on the most famous types: Key-Value, Document, Column-family and Graph database types: Key-Value, Document, Column-family and Graph databases;

=== Key-Value Databases

These are the simplest storage types between the NoSQL databases. They store data as a collection of key-value pairs, making them ideal for high-speed data retrieval by using keys. This database type has a structure that resembles a `java.util.Map` API where values are mapped to keys.

Currently on the market, there are many vendors that provides solutions for this NoSQL database type. Some of them are: Amazon DynamoDB, Redis, Hazelcast, Memcached, among others. The latter three mentioned here being open source technologies.

// One thing to keep in mind is that, beyond each vendor brings its own unique benefits, they can offer different way to deal with data; DynamoDB can be used as a fully managed service, acting not just as key-value database only but as a document database as well; which means that we have many flavours on the market.
